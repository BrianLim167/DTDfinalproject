6/8/17
    new features:
    	towers shoot stuff in their range, based off of their rate of fire
	Creeps display health as a number, purely for testing things

    bugs:
	When towers have nothing in their range, there are occational crashes, needs more testing
	If a tower has nothing in its range, its shooting cooldown is still reset
	Creeps don't despawn on death, yet
